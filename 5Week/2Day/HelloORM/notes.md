# Week 5 Session 2
## Housekeeping Notes:

    - Bring your code/questions/ideas/good cheer!
- Veterans Day (this Monday) will be an observed holiday
    - Make up lecture will be held Tuesday 11/12, same time/same channel
## ORMs & SQL Alchemy
- ORM: Object Relational Mapper
    - Allows us to "map" our database tables to python classes
    - Makes table relationships, and the necessary queries much easier than raw SQL
- SQL Alchemy: An ORM we can use in Flask
    - For this section, we will be using a SQLite DB rather than MySQL (however, it's possible to hook into a MySQL database as well)
- Tools:
    - SQLlite VS Code extension
    - flask shell (cool thing I discovered, not in platform)

## Lecture:
- Setting up a project with ORM (one table)
- Working with two related tables (Users -> Posts) in a demo project (POSTerized)
